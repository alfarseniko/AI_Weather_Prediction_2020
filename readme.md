This project was made for my elective course "AI in the Built Environment".

The goal was to create a prediction model for any civil engineering use. And then compare the two models (Random Forests and Neural Networks) for their accuracy.

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data).
